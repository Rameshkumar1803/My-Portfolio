      Hi, I’m Ramesh Kumar, a backend-focused developer and B.Tech IT student at Galgotias College. I love building scalable web apps, REST APIs, and automation tools using Node.js, MongoDB, PHP, and Python.

At <b>Nothing Technology</b>, I identified over 900+ critical bugs, sharpening my debugging and QA skills. I lead Competitive Programming & DSA at Google DSC GCET and was selected for the Aspire Leaders Program by Harvard Business School.

I’ve built projects like a URL Shortener, Task Scheduler, and Disaster Data Aggregator, and currently hold a LeetCode global rank under 100K, actively solving real-world problems through code.
